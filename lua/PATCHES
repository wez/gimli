This version of lua has the following patches applied:

-----

A patch to allow "\xAA" as a means for specifying 8-bit hex constants
in strings, where "AA" is a two digit hex number.

The same patch also enables "\uAAAA" and "\uBBBBBB" as a means for
specifying unicode code points.  These are 4 and 6 digit hex numbers.
The code points are internally encoded as a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence.

This patch is inspired by 
svn://slugak.dyndns.org/public/lua-patches/literals.patch

(see changeset [19])

-----

A patch to recognize octal numbers when they have a leading 0
(see changeset [16])

http://darkmist.newmail.ru/bitwise_operators_for_lua_5.1.3.patch

Infix bitwise operators for AND (&, __and), OR (|, __or), XOR (^^, __xor).
Infix bitwise operators for SHIFT LEFT (<<, __shl) and SHIFT RIGHT (>>, __shr).
Unary bitwise negation operator (~, __not).
Infix arithmetic operator for INTEGER DIVISION (\, __intdiv).
accepts both ~= and != for comparison.
All these features can be disabled with undefining LUA_BITWISE_OPERATORS in
luaconf.h.

Bitwise operators first convert a lua_Number to a lua_Integer and convert back
the result to a lua_Number.

(see changeset [15])
