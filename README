gimli is a crash tracing/analysis framework.

The concept is that an executable can be linked with libgimli to enable
tracing support.

A gimli enabled application may then be run under supervision of a monitor
process that can detect if the application has stalled, and invoke a trace and
then optionally restart the supervised application.

The tracing is carried out by a glider process.  The glider will gather a
stack trace for all threads in the target process and can also load additional
tracing modules to gather even more information about the problem.

For each mapped module in the traced process address space, the glider will
locate a trace module with a corresponding name.  The trace module can
interrogate the target process to find key datastructures and interpret them
into readable information for the trace file.
